<p align="center">Hey John,</p>
<p align="center">So here are some random pictures for you (they aren't in page 
order so they won't make sense if you read the dialog):</p>
<p align="center"><a href="berserk%20-%20v22c02p040%20copy.jpg">
<img border="2" src="berserk%20-%20v22c02p040%20copy.jpg" width="250" height="378"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="berserk%20-%20v22c02p041%20copy.jpg"><img border="2" src="berserk%20-%20v22c02p041%20copy.jpg" width="250" height="367"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="berserk%20-%20v22c03p058%20copy.jpg">
<img border="2" src="berserk%20-%20v22c03p058%20copy.jpg" width="250" height="370"></a></p>
<p align="center"><a href="berserk%20-%20v22c03p064-065%20copy.jpg">
<img border="2" src="berserk%20-%20v22c03p064-065%20copy.jpg" width="500" height="367"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="berserk%20-%20v22c03p069%20copy.jpg"><img border="2" src="berserk%20-%20v22c03p069%20copy.jpg" width="250" height="365"></a></p>

<p align="center">And for kicks, here are 2 short video clips from the Japanese 
Video game of Berserk, showing the fight between Guts and Zoddo:</p>
<p align="center"><b><a href="clip1.mpg">clip 1 (human form)</a></b><br>
<b><a href="clip2.mpg">clip 2 (apostle form)</a></b></p>
<p align="center">(use right click, save target as)</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">So I noticed, that there are some snow-covered trees in the 
background as well some snow-covered rocks, and another mountain/hill as well.&nbsp; 
It'll be really cool if you could add a tree or two and some rocks to the 
diorama.&nbsp; In regards to the mountain/hill in the background, well that's 
probably not possible, but I guess some elevation changes in the hill that Zoddo 
and Guts fight on would be nice.</p>
<p align="left">Also, if you are wondering, Zoddo starts the fight in his human 
form, but starts to lose so he changes into his Apostle form.</p>
<p align="left">Color schemes:<br>
- Guts you know well.&nbsp; His brand on the back of his neck is probably really 
small, but if you could make it bleed out too, that'll be cool.&nbsp; Guts' 
brand always bleeds like crazy when Zoddo is around.&nbsp; Also, Guts is really 
beat up in this scene.&nbsp; He just returned from battling another apostle, so 
he's not in good condition.&nbsp; So feel free to bloody/weather him up a bit.<br>
- Zoddo is basically dark brown, with red eyes.&nbsp; He could also have some 
blood on him, especially on his claws, and teeth.</p>
<p align="left">Other reminders:<br>
- Cut off Zoddo's LEFT horn.<br>
- Put Gut's sword above his head.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I guess that's about all for now.&nbsp; Make sure to download 
those little video clips.&nbsp; They are pretty cool. =)</p>
<p align="left">Thanks John!&nbsp; This piece is gonna rock!&nbsp; SERIOUSLY!</p>
