          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Yes, 
          there are a few differences:</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1. The
          <i>Art of War</i> releases come with thick cardboard, metal edged 
          boxes.&nbsp; The first four US <i>Toycom</i> releases don't (<i>Guts: 
          Hawk Soldier</i>, <i>Guts: Birth Feast</i>, <i>Casca: Hawk Soldier</i>, 
          and <i>Griffith: Hawk Soldier)</i>.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2. The <i>Toycom</i> statues have painted nameplates 
          (with the exception of <i>Griffith: MF on Horse</i>).&nbsp; The <i>Art 
          of War</i> statues, however, have actual metal nameplates.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3. The <i>Art of War</i> statues are serialized on the box as well as 
          on the metal nameplate.&nbsp; The <i>Toycom </i>statues are not (with 
          the exception of <i>Griffith: MF on Horse</i>).</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Also, I've compared several of the <i>Toycom</i> statues side by side 
          with their counterpart <i>Art of War </i>statues and I have noticed a 
          slight difference in paint quality.&nbsp; In my personal opinion, I do 
          feel that the original <i>Art of War</i> statues are painted with 
          SLIGHTLY more detail and precision.&nbsp; For example, when going from 
          skin to armor, there might be some paint bleed on the <i>Toycom</i> 
          releases, but not so much on the <i>Art of War</i> ones.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">However, I've also compared 2 of the same <i>Art of War</i> statues 
          together side by side, and ALL of them vary a little bit.&nbsp; Since 
          all the statues are hand painted, each and every one will have a few 
          minor differences no matter what.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So, in terms of paint quality, both <i>Art of War</i> and <i>Toycom</i> 
          statues are beautiful and these minor differences should not bother 
          you.&nbsp; You can't really tell either unless you hold them side by 
          side.&nbsp; Even when you do that, it's not very apparent either.&nbsp; 
          But in regards with having serialized nameplates, that is really all 
          up to you.</font></p>

          prompt you to add your shipping information and email, etc.&nbsp; There, 
          you will also be able to choose your shipping preference: EMS or 
          Seamail.&nbsp; DEFINITELY choose EMS because it's insured and it takes a 
          week (at most) to get your statues.&nbsp; Seamail is not insured and it 
          takes 3-4 weeks.&nbsp; I've also received damage items when using 
          Seamail, but have had flawless experiences with EMS.&nbsp; So, though it's

          Unfortunately not.&nbsp; This sculpt is so extravagant and delicate

          However, at that time, <i>Art of War</i> offered painting and assembly 
          services, so many of those 100 kits were actually built by AOW

          how much they charged their customers for service on the <i>Griffith 
          on Horse</i> kit and they told me $300.&nbsp; That's quite cheap, in 
          my opinion, for this particular kit.&nbsp; Whoever was lucky enough to 
          get one of the 100 kits and also get it painted by <i>Art of War</i>

          also hard to come by because they are not sold by<i> Art of War</i>.&nbsp; 
          I've emailed them about this and they informed me that ALL statues

          However, this of course doesn't mean that if you own a # 0000 statue

          exception of <i>Toycom</i> releases and the non-bloody <i>Zoddo: 
          Apostle</i> statues).&nbsp; The <i>limited</i> edition variants almost 
          always start numbering first.&nbsp; After all the <i>limited</i> 
          edition statues have been numbered, then the numbering for the <i>
          normal</i> edition statues picks up from there.&nbsp; Meaning, if 
          there are 300 <i>limited </i>edition statues, then the first <i>normal</i> 
          edition statue will be numbered # 301.&nbsp; Therefore, when a statue 
          is numbered, that number doesn't necessarily describe how many of that

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Kits are basically unassembled 
      and unpainted statues.&nbsp; They are generally made of the same material 
      pre-painted statues are made of too (resin).&nbsp; 
      Kits are usually created and sculpted by amateur artists that sell their 
      models at hobby shows exclusive to Japan.&nbsp; However, when I say 
      &quot;amateur&quot;, by no means am I implying that these kits are of lesser quality 
      than &quot;professional&quot; models (such as <i>Art of War</i>).&nbsp; This just 
      means that they aren't mass produced and sold to a production company that 
      can distribute to all parts of the world.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thus, kits are in many ways 
      much more valuable than pre-painted statues.&nbsp; Most of the time, no 
      more than 50-100 copies of each kit are made because the original artists 
      usually don't have the time, money, or equipment to produce anymore.&nbsp; 
      Also, each mold made by the original sculpt will lose 
      detail and pretty soon become unusable.&nbsp; So, if you think about it,
      <i>limited </i>edition statues by <i>Art of War </i>usually number around 
      300 in the world, and are already insanely difficult to find.&nbsp; Divide 
      that number by 5, and that's how many kits exist... Pretty crazy huh?</font></td>

      RARE.&nbsp; And as you know, rare items tend to shoot up in value, 
      especially when it comes to collecting.&nbsp; However, sometimes there are 
      kits that are sculpted and licensed by a company, such as <i>Kotobukiya</i>,
      <i>Wave</i>, <i>Field</i>, or <i>Kaiyodo</i> (to name a few), and those 
      kits are usually mass produced (to a certain extent) and can cost a little 
      less.&nbsp; However, everything of course is dependent on how high the

      the price suggests, they are cheaper in quality too.&nbsp; Many of these 
      recasts are Thai recasts, which are notorious for being even worse.&nbsp; 
      However, some recasts (like certain Hong Kong recasts) can be decent and some artists believe if done 
      properly, a recast can even turn out better than an original if the 
      original's casting was poor to begin with and was prepped and fixed up

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, this is a topic that is 
      quite controversial in the hobby world.&nbsp; Of course, the main reason 
      for most is morality.&nbsp; Recasts are technically illegal because their 
      is no agreement made between the original sculptor and the recaster.&nbsp; 
      So then copyright issues come in to play, and everything gets messy.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Well, it's not like I'm making money off it.&quot; or &quot;Well, only 30 exist and 
      I don't live in Japan.&nbsp; How else am I supposed to get one?&quot; or &quot;With 
      such low availability, recasting actually helps the model industry because 
      it allows more people to have a chance to work on one.&quot;&nbsp; It goes on 
      and on.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I for one, don't have anything 
      against people that paint recasts.&nbsp; I don't think they are hurting 
      anyone or the sculptor for that matter.&nbsp; However, I personally buy 
      original kits because in my mind, if it's not the <i>original</i>, it's 
      not the real thing.&nbsp; I think for most hardcore collectors, they will 
      agree.&nbsp; It's like a baseball card.&nbsp; If you are a collector, you 
      wouldn't want a copy even IF it LOOKS exactly the same.&nbsp; Authenticity 
      is important.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Additionally, I prefer 
      originals because I believe the quality of the kit is better (and most of 
      the time it is).&nbsp; I'm always one that strives for quality.&nbsp; I 
      buy CDs over mp3s, I buy official DVDs over bootlegs, and I buy originals 
      over recasts.&nbsp; Simple as that.</font></td>

          completed models and more importantly, it's not artistically exciting

          continuously supply him <i>Berserk</i> kits, he will not work on any
