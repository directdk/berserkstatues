      also because very little is known about all the wonderful rare Japanese

      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I have partnered up with the 
      very reputable <a href="http://www.skullknight.net"><b>www.skullknight.net</b></a><font color="#FFFFFF">,

      bit about me...</font></b><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, let's see... in 2006, I 
      graduated from <i>Expression - College of Digital Arts</i> in Emeryville, 
      California.&nbsp; There, I earned a bachelor's degree in sound 
      engineering/mixing/recording/production/etc.&nbsp; Prior to attending <i>Expression, </i>I graduated from the 
      <i>University of California, Berkeley</i>, in 2003.&nbsp; There, I studied music 
      and cognition.&nbsp; Woo hoo!</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So as you can probably tell from 
      my academic history, music is and will always remain as my first love.&nbsp; 
      You can visit <b><a href="http://www.magnetichiphop.com">
      www.magnetichiphop.com</a> </b>to check out some of my work.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I also have a personal

      <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">a little bit about <i>
      Berserk</i>...</font></b><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><i>Berserk </i>is a 
       
      Japanese manga (comic), created, written, and drawn by 
      Kentarou Miura... who in my opinion is a story-telling genius.&nbsp; It is 
      still actively being published and read in Japan by &quot;Young Animal&quot; and this past year was 
      acquired by &quot;Dark Horse&quot; for release in America.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Through the years, 
      story arcs from <i>Berserk</i> were adapted into a 25-episode Japanese 
      anime, a video game for the Sega Dreamcast called &quot;Sword of the Berserk&quot;, 
      and just recently a video game for the Sony Playstation 2 called 
      &quot;Millennium Falcon - The Holy Evil War&quot;.&nbsp; Listen to all the inspiring 
      music that has spawned from these projects by clicking the song titles on 
      the bottom Flash frame.&nbsp; All songs were written and sung by Susumu 
      Hirasawa.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;<p align="justify">
      <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">a little bit about the 
      story of <i>Berserk</i>...</font></b><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hmmm, there's no way on earth 
      I'll be able to describe the story of <i>Berserk</i> that will do it 
      justice, but if I were to label it, I would say it's a dark fantasy set in 
      a world similar to the medieval times.&nbsp; There's lots of blood... 
      gore... violence... torture... hmm... yah... by the way, I should probably 
      mention it's &quot;mature&quot; rated, hehe.&nbsp; Of course, however, by no means 
      is the story just about a bunch of bad-asses that are freakishly strong, 
      but rather a very complex tale of loyalty, religion, philosophy, 
      causality, identity, and my favorite one... love. =)&nbsp; Yep, gotta have 
      love.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The central character of <i>
      Berserk</i> is Guts, a torn-up, cursed, vengeful warrior struggling 
      in every sense to battle destiny.&nbsp; He carries a huge dull sword 
      called the <i>Dragon Slayer</i>, but it's so large and heavy that it'll 
      rip through armor and weapons anyways =).&nbsp; He was born in a puddle 
      full of blood, underneath his hanging, dead mother... and he lost his 
      right eye and left arm during one of the many tribulations in his wretched 
      life.&nbsp; As you can see, we all hope that one day Guts will finally 
      find and <i>keep </i>happiness.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I could  go on and on 
      about <i>Berserk</i>, but really the best way to learn about the world of
      <i>Berserk</i> (other than actually reading it), is to visit my affiliate, <b>
      <a href="http://www.skullknight.net">www.skullknight.net</a></b>,<b>
      </b>and read 
      the &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;.&nbsp; Out of all the many <i>Berserk</i> websites out 
      there, this one is definitely my favorite and most comprehensive.&nbsp; 
      There are also plenty of intelligent discussions inside the forum.&nbsp; 
      Check it out when you get the chance!</font><p align="justify">

      <b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">a little bit about me, <i>
      Berserk</i>, and model collecting...</font></b><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I've been collecting anime/manga/video-game 
      statues &amp; kits for several years now, and of course, <i>Berserk</i> is my 
      favorite of all favorites!&nbsp; I don't know what it is... but something 
      about <i>Berserk</i> really has an impact on my emotions.&nbsp; The 
      characters, the story, the art, the music... I adore everything about it.&nbsp; 
      As strange as this may sound, <i>Berserk</i> keeps life interesting.&nbsp; 
      Every now and then I just need to drift away from reality and dive into 
      the fantasy world that Kentarou Miura so brilliantly portrays.&nbsp; 
      Actually, it's simply therapeutic.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With that in mind, visualizing 
      a character from <i>Berserk</i> in a 3-dimensional form appealed greatly 
      to me.&nbsp; I didn't really collect any statues until 2001, when I bought 
      my first <i>Berserk</i> statue, <i>Guts: the Black Swordsman: Episode of 
      Birth Feast</i>, a 
      masterpiece sculpted and painted by &quot;Art of War&quot;.&nbsp; After that... it 
      all went downhill =P.</font><p align="justify">
