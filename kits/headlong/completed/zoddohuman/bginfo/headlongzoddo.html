<title>Headlong Zoddo: Human Form</title>
</head>

<body>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So, here I will try my best to describe ZODDO for 
you:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the story of <i>
Berserk, </i>he is known as Nosferatu Zoddo, and as the legend goes, he has been 
fighting in wars for over 300 years.&nbsp; He is thought to be immortal because 
of this, and even if witnesses say that he was killed in a battle, he will 
always show up time and time again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has two forms (Human and Apostle/Beast).&nbsp; He is 
already virtually unstoppable in Human form, and can grow 10 times stronger when 
he mutates into his Apostle/Beast form.&nbsp; He is a giant mass of muscle and 
he wields a large &quot;beheading sword&quot; that contains an eye on the blade.&nbsp; 
Zoddo is also basically the right hand of the Son of Evil and is different than 
most demons and evil creatures because he demonstrates wisdom and un-surpassing 
loyalty.&nbsp; Most of the demons and other Apostles in the story are very 
mindless, greedy, disgusting beings.&nbsp; Zoddo, on the other hand is very 
&quot;noble&quot;.&nbsp; He's basically the bad guy that everyone loves. =)</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here are some manga scans of his Human form:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just for kicks, here is a cover art of him in his Apostle/Beast form:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="08.jpg" width="425" height="565"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, since <i>Berserk</i> is mostly a 
manga, the pictures are in black and white.&nbsp; Here's a fan-artist that drew 
his own picture of Zoddo and added color to it as well:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="fan_art_01.jpg" width="600" height="600"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And, here's a reference picture from HEADLONG's 
very own website:</font></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="http://www.geocities.jp/headlong037/b01/zod_fg.jpg" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(You can also view the entire assembled kit here:
<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.jp/headlong037/">
http://www.geocities.jp/headlong03/</a></b> )</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lastly, if you click <b>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.berserkstatues.com/statues/zoddohuman.html">
HERE</a></b>, this will take you to the prepainted Zoddo: Human Form statue by 
ART OF WAR, so you can see more images of the color scheme.&nbsp; ART OF WAR is 
an official statue developer for <i>Berserk</i> and all their sculpts are done 
under the supervision of Kentarou Miura (the writer &amp; artist of <i>Berserk</i>).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now, in terms of details, let's start with the 
sword.&nbsp; The sword that HEADLONG made appears to be Zoddo's older sword, and 
is NOT the sword that has the eye on the blade.&nbsp; Also, if you notice, the 
sword on the prepainted Zoddo by ART OF WAR is also the old sword.&nbsp; The old 
sword is a little boring to me.&nbsp; The sword that Zoddo currently wields is 
this one:</font></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="berserk%20-%20v22c03p052%20copy.jpg" width="600" height="529"></p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="berserk%20-%20v22c04p073%20copy.jpg" width="600" height="237"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Berserk%20-%20v08c02p22.jpg" width="223" height="463"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Notice the little hook/half-circle shape at the 
end of the blade, the eye and eye brow, and the saw-like look on one edge of the 
sword.&nbsp; I know you do sculpting as well, so I was wondering if it's 
possible if you can somehow emulate this sword more, instead of leaving it so 
plain looking?&nbsp; Will it be hard to make that hook/half-circle shape?&nbsp; 
Also, will an eye that's simply painted on look awkward unless there's actually 
some physical altercation on the blade?&nbsp; If these two things require a 
great deal of effort and time, and you rather not do it, then that is okay.&nbsp; 
Don't worry about it.&nbsp; I actually just thought of the idea today, and I 
thought I'd bring it up since it would make the piece more interesting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In terms of skin color, the color of the skin in 
the prepainted ART OF WAR statue is pretty cool.&nbsp; Also, the skin color in 
the fan-picture up above is also pretty accurate.&nbsp; I would prefer the skin 
color to be something like that, though of course it doesn't have to be exact or 
anything.&nbsp; On the other hand, the skin color of the actual HEADLONG 
reference picture, I feel is a little too gray.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">With regards to the fur/animal skin (or whatever 
the hell he is wearing), I don't really care what color it is.&nbsp; I sort of 
picture it dark in color, like a black, or a gray, or a brown, or something like 
that.&nbsp; The truth is, I'm not certain EXACTLY what the color of his clothing 
is simply because all the manga pages are printed in black and white.&nbsp; It's 
sort of left up to the imagination.&nbsp; As long as you don't paint it bright 
orange or yellow or something, I think I'll be okay.&nbsp; Hehe.&nbsp; What are 
your thoughts?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">About veins... unfortunately, HEADLONG didn't 
sculpt any veins on Zoddo's body, like his arms.&nbsp; In the manga, Zoddo 
constantly has bulging veins all over his body.&nbsp; It would be nice if you 
could somehow achieve this look (if possible).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">And lastly, in regards to blood.&nbsp; I'm not 
sure how to approach this really.&nbsp; <i>Berserk</i> is FULL of blood.&nbsp; 
It's a very gory comic.&nbsp; I would really like the statue to be bloody, but 
at the same time, I'm not sure if lots of blood will look tacky.&nbsp; ART OF 
WAR often has blood on there &quot;limited edition&quot; variants and I think it looks 
pretty nice.&nbsp; But, I've seen all your blood textures and paints on your 
website and I like your blood effects more (it looks more realistic).&nbsp; I 
would like for you to make the kit/sword bloody, but in terms of HOW bloody it 
should be, I leave it up to your artistic expertise.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I think that's about all for now.&nbsp; If you 
have ANY questions, about Zoddo as a character, or about the kit preferences, 
please let me know.&nbsp; I really want to be able to communicate.&nbsp; 
Actually, I can't remember if I gave you my phone number last time we talked, so 
here it is, just in case: 510-847-7062 (cell), and 510-649-7675 (apt).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I look forward to your reply!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PS:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- FYI, about the progress photos, one of the main 
reasons why I want them is not because I want to check up on how everything is 
going, but actually because the whole build-up/painting process really 
fascinates me.&nbsp; I also plan to put up all the in-progress photos on my 
website so people can see what you, the artist, went through to achieve the 
final product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- I forgot to mention earlier.&nbsp; Please make 
sure NOT to throw away any of the kit's packaging materials (like the white 
paper strip that is stapled to the plastic bag, and whatever papers that are 
inside).&nbsp; I want to keep these as reference and &quot;proof&quot; that this is an 
original/authentic Japanese kit.&nbsp; Thanks!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- What do you have in mind for the base, or is it 
too soon to tell?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- I was looking through your website again, and 
your face/bust paint jobs are AMAZING (like the Phantom one... I can't even look 
at it because he looks so real and his eyes are SCARY).&nbsp; Anyways, I have 
this one kit that I think you will be PERFECT for it.&nbsp; It's right up your 
alley, I think!&nbsp; All the teeth, and everything. =P&nbsp; It looks like 
this:</font></p>
