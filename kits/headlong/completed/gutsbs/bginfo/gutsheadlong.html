<p>HEADLONG - GUTS: BLACK SWORDSMAN BACKGROUND INFO</p>
<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>It's really late right now (3:30am) and I'm running a bit late for my plane 
flight.&nbsp; So I might sound disoriented when writing this. =P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So GUTS, is the main character of the story.&nbsp; He's also my favorite 
character.&nbsp; He only has one eye and one real arm (his left arm was cut off 
around the elbow in a fight, but has a mechanical arm forged by the same 
blacksmith that created his sword).</p>
<p>He has plenty of scars all over his body and face, but the one that has 
significant meaning is the scar that goes horizontal across his nose (you can 
pretty much see it in all the pictures).&nbsp; If you could paint in scars (or 
even give him some scars by using a razor or something and cut small slits in 
the kit, or something i dunno =P) that would be cool.&nbsp; The scar on his 
nose, though, should have already been sculpted in by HEADLONG.</p>
<p>He also has this BRAND on the back right of his neck.&nbsp; I'm not sure if 
HEADLONG even sculpted it, because it's possible that the sword over his 
shoulder is blocking it.&nbsp; There are some pictures of the brand and the 
location of it at the bottom of this page.&nbsp; IF indeed, the brand is 
sculpted in and it shows, it would be nice you painted blood seeping out of it 
(the brand is red in color as well).&nbsp; Whenever evil beings are close to 
Guts, the brand bleeds.</p>
<p>One last thing to mention is the gigantic sword.&nbsp; It's known as the 
Dragon Slayer, and if you notice, the middle part of the blade is darker color 
than the rest of the blade.&nbsp; This is pretty important as it's sort of the 
trademark of the sword's appearance.&nbsp; Please make sure to color the middle 
part of the sword darker than the rest.&nbsp; And in general, the sword is very 
important so if you could make sure to paint the sword with extreme detail, I'll 
be VERY GRATEFUL.&nbsp; Thanks =).</p>
<p>Also, just as the name of the kit suggests, Guts is known as the Black 
Swordsman, so generally, his armor is blackish.&nbsp; His cape is also black, 
etc etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the character himself, Gut is a human, but because he has killed SO 
MANY demons and evil beings, his sword is becoming possessed, which also affects 
him when he fights.&nbsp; He's a struggler, trying to fight his destiny, save 
his love, and get revenge on the one responsible for everything (sounds typical, 
but the story is actually VERY intricate).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, I'm sorry I have to cut this short, but I really have to go now.&nbsp; I 
can't miss this flight.&nbsp; THANK YOU and I will keep in touch via EMAIL.&nbsp; 
Please send in progress pics when you can.&nbsp; Talk to you later!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
