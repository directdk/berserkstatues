good ref pictures</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>- light brown/tan bodies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>- the colors up above are good, but i think you can make 
the bodies a little darker/tanner.<br>
<b>- dark brown eyes/nose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>- as you can see in the pictures, the outline of the 
eyes/nose are dark brown (pretty self explanatory i guess =P)<br>
<b>- dark brown symbol in middle of chest</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - again, pretty self explanatory<br>
<b>- green moss<br>
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - there is actually some moss included with the kit, that 
you can spread around his body/head</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial">TEXTURE</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Well, basically these creatures are made out of mud/dirt, 
so even though the kit itself is very smooth, it'll be nice to paint it in a way 
that it looks like his body is a little fluffy with creases and stuff like that.&nbsp; 
also, feel free to paint some green details on his body too, like there's some 
grass on him or something (like the whole moss idea)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And that's that!</font></p>
