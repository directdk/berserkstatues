      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well this was a pleasant 
      surprise!&nbsp; I was never a huge fan of this kit, but I did appreciate 
      the fact that it's quite tall (around 30 cm).&nbsp; I thought the kit 
      could have had more detail, given the size of it.&nbsp; The pose is pretty 
      static as well, but that didn't bother me too much, especially since it 
      was modeled after a specific scene (see below).&nbsp; So, I just sorta 
      sent it out to John in hopes that he will bring the kit to life.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Upon receiving the kit, John 
      asked if I had any special requests to maybe spice things up a notch.&nbsp; 
      I thought some limbs and intestines lying around would be nice, and some 
      blood seeping out of <i>Wyald's</i> <i>Apostle </i>mouth would be 
      appropriate.&nbsp; I also showed him several pictures of <i>Wyald</i> 
      tearing things up and battling with <i>Guts</i>.&nbsp; I asked him to 
      paint some battle scars (such as the wound he received above his lip when
      <i>Guts </i>stabbed him).&nbsp; John took note of all of the details and 
      followed through as usual.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">However, when he showed me a 
      mock-up of the dead body lying in front of <i>Wyald</i>, I thought maybe 
      the body wasn't the appropriate scale, and it didn't add too much 
      excitement to the piece.&nbsp; So, John noticed there were tons of 
      soldiers in the manga scans I sent him, so he found a nice little <i>Lord 
      of the Rings</i> figure of a soldier riding a horse that he could use for 
      the kit.&nbsp; The scale was perfect and I LOVE horses so I was all for 
      it.&nbsp; So he painted it up and everything, but when I saw the final 
      pictures, I realized that it just didn't look right.&nbsp; No one in the 
      story could stand up to<i> Wyald's Apostle</i> form.&nbsp; Everyone was 
      screaming and running for their lives.&nbsp; And when I saw this<i> LOTR</i> 
      soldier valiantly facing <i>Wyald</i> in battle, I thought it gave the 
      wrong impression of the scene.&nbsp; ONLY <i>GUTS</i> can be facing <i>
      Wyald</i>.&nbsp; And so, I remembered that <i>Art of War</i> made a mini 
      figure of <i>Guts: Maken</i> for Volume 5, and I decided to go with that 
      figure instead.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">John had to made some modifications to the 
      original <i>AOW Guts </i>figure.&nbsp; He heated the plastic so he could 
      bend <i>Guts'</i> neck to look upwards, and his arms to hold his sword in 
      front of him, as seen in the manga.&nbsp; John also repainted the entire 
      figure and painted <i>Guts</i> face in such a way to show distress and 
      concern, because the original <i>AOW</i> <i>Guts</i> looked very calm and 
      composed.&nbsp; I didn't want John to go crazy on the face expression 
      though, just something subtle.&nbsp; I thought it would be more powerful 
      this way, and in the end, John did an excellent job adding a hint of worry 
      on <i>Guts</i>' face, especially since the head is not even bigger than 
      half an inch!</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As for <i>Wyald</i>, I was 
      super pleased with the way the muscles, mouth, and eyes turned out.&nbsp; 
      The mouth and lips look so disgusting it's awesome!&nbsp; And I think the 
      colors John used are perfect.&nbsp; Because <i>Wyald </i>never appeared in 
      color in the manga, there is no real way for me to know what color he is!&nbsp; 
      I could only speculate that the fur is white and that's about it.&nbsp; 
      Needless to say, the colors John used look totally fitting and the blue 
      eyes were an excellent choice, because now they really stand out and glare 
      right at you!&nbsp; Attaching the limbs together was tough too, because 
      John had to blend the joints with putty, and then use a dremel to carve in 
      some indents to make the fur look seamless.</font><p align="justify">
      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And so here it is!&nbsp; A 
      beautifully painted kit of <i>Wyald</i> facing the almighty <i>Guts</i>!&nbsp; 
      I couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.&nbsp; This piece has 
      easily shot straight up to be one of my favorite ones, and you all know 
      how many <i>Berserk </i>models I own. =)&nbsp; <i>Getsurou</i> did an awesome job 
      recreating<i> Wyald</i>, despite my initial impressions.&nbsp; This kit 
      rocks!&nbsp; And of course, a big thanks to John, as 
      always, for dealing with all of my requests and for painting up the <i>
      LOTR </i>figure only to end up not using it at all.&nbsp; But man, I'm 
      sure glad we didn't end up using it, because there's NO WAY it would have 
      looked as good as the way it does now!&nbsp; Enjoy the pictures!</font><p align="center">
