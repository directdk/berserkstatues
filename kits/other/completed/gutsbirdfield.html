      <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When I decided to get this <i>
      Guts</i> kit painted, I wanted to do something extraordinary. My birthday 
      was coming up in a week so I felt like I should treat myself and go all 
      out! So I thought of ways to spice up this kit, and that's when I 
      remembered I had a <i>Bird Disciple</i> resin bust, made by <i>Art of War</i>. 
      For those that aren't familiar with it, it's a bonus item that is supposed 
      to attach to the <i>Guts: Black Swordsman</i> action figure that was 
      released towards the beginning of <i>AOW's</i> <i>Berserk</i> merchandise 
      line-up. It's a neat little bust, but leaves much to be desired since it's 
      so small and looks more just like a random head than anything else. You 
      can see a stock picture of it <b>
      <a target="_blank" href="gutsbirdfield/finals/birdref.jpg">here</a></b>.<br>
      <br>
      Anyhow, so originally I asked John if he could have blood and intestines 
      pouring from his waist since there was no lower body. But instead, John 
      suggested that he could sculpt the lower half of the <i>Bird Disciple's</i> 
      body to make it a full figure. This was actually a REALLY good suggestion 
      because the <i>Bird Disciple</i> doesn't die by getting chopped in half, 
      but rather he dies from a sword swipe to the neck. And now with his whole 
      body intact, John would be able to show this.<br>
      <br>
      So he made the general shape of the <i>Disciple's</i> body with aluminum, 
      and then covered it with putty to detail the curves and folds. Then he 
      used a real buckle to imprint the buckles on his cloak. After baking and 
      hardening the putty, he primed it, and painted it with a firey orange with 
      brown highlights so the blood and details will have a stronger contrast. 
      The blood spewing from the <i>Disciple's</i> neck was done with a kind of 
      epoxy to add some thickness. Very nice touch if you ask me! For the belt, 
      John just used a rubber-band that he glued into place and painted over. 
      For the <i>Bird Disciple's</i> weapon, he folded a piece of thin metal to 
      recreate the omega sign, and then used the teeth of an old hair comb for 
      all the spikes. What a brilliant idea! And of course, he chopped the <i>
      Disciple's</i> weapon in half to follow the scene in the manga.<br>
      <br>
      Then, there was the setting that we had to recreate. I sent a whole bunch 
      of pictures to John so he could get a good idea of where this battle took 
      place. After reviewing them, the most notable part of the scene was when 
      the tower came crumbling down soon after <i>Guts</i> kills the <i>Bird 
      Disciple</i>. So naturally, John and I wanted to portray this with the 
      diorama. For the stairs, John cut the wood pieces and then plastered it to 
      give it that stone look. He used balsa-foam to carve and sculpt the walls 
      and rubble. After carving all the details, he primed it and painted it as 
      you see down below. Also, if you look close, you can see feathers lying 
      around the stairs too. Originally, John was going to use real down 
      feathers, but the look and scale just didn't fit properly. So instead, 
      John took it upon himself to sculpt feathers to scale and just paint them 
      appropriately. What a cool guy. =)<br>
      <br>
      And now we come to the <i>specters</i>... I really wanted the <i>specters</i> 
      to make an appearance in this diorama. I remember reading this part in the 
      manga and I was so terrified by these googly creatures/spirits that just 
      annihilated everything in their paths. I thought adding this extra feature 
      to the diorama would really add a nice <i>Berserk</i> touch. My only worry 
      was that the diorama might end up looking too busy, but I think it ended 
      up looking superb. John sculpted the <i>specters</i> out of putty, and 
      then carved in a total of ten faces. Some of them are facing the viewer, 
      and the others are facing <i>Guts</i>.<br>
      <br>
      Lastly... is <i>Guts</i> himself! I've always been a fan of this kit 
      because it's dynamic, the cape is awesome, and <i>Guts</i> is equipped 
      with his cross-brow! Also, the details on the armor and accessories are 
      excellent so I was really pumped to see John paint this baby up. And as 
      expected, John did an amazing job. He used a piece of metal for the 
      crossbow string so it's more sturdy, and the crossbow is also removable if 
      I want to remove it for display (not like I ever would!). The sword 
      blood-work was also done with a kind of epoxy to add some texture and 
      depth. It looks absolutely gross and wonderful at the same time. =)<br>
      <br>
      In the end, the diorama measures 14&quot; x 12&quot; x 14&quot;. A true masterpiece. John 
      never ceases to amaze me and this new kit is proof. He turned a simple kit 
      and bust into something of a completely different magnitude. This couldn't 
      have been a better birthday present. I am so incredibly happy! Thank you, 
      John, you are my hero!</font><p align="center">
